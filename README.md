# Medical_Seg_Semi

A semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework combining Masked Autoencoding (MAE) and Bidirectional CutMix Pseudo-labeling (BCP). Designed for experiments on the ACDC dataset using U-Net and ResUNet architectures.

## ðŸ“‚ Overview

This repository contains:
- Pretraining with MAE for visual representation learning
- Self-training with BCP for semi-supervised segmentation
- Visualization, logging, and checkpointing tools

## ðŸ”§ Installation
