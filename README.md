# BCP-based Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation

This repository presents my first research project on **semi-supervised learning**, applied to **medical image segmentation**. It includes both a comprehensive **literature survey** and an implementation of a novel approach called **Bidirectional Copy-Paste (BCP)**, built on top of the **Mean Teacher framework**.

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

Manual segmentation in medical imaging is expensive and time-consuming, especially in clinical settings. This project aims to:

- Reduce the need for large amounts of labeled data
- Improve segmentation performance using **semi-supervised learning (SSL)**
- Explore and implement the **Mean Teacher + BCP** architecture
- Apply it to the **ACDC** cardiac MRI dataset using U-Net backbone
